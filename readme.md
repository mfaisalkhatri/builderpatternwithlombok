## :question: What is this Repository about?
- This repo contains example code for generating the fake test data using [Builder design pattern in Java](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder)
   [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) and [DataFaker](https://www.datafaker.net/) library. 
- This repo uses Maven as build tool and TestNG testing framework to run the tests.
- To run the test from command line use the following command: `mvn clean install` 
- Tests can also be run using TestNG by right-clicking on the `testng.xml` file and selecting the option `Run ..
  \testng.xml`
